The project's objective is to develop a comprehensive vCard database application, ensuring methodical execution of tasks based on user input. The program is designed to fulfill 
fundamental requirements:

1. Facilitate user entry of new contacts, enabling their storage.
2. Enable efficient searching by name, phone number, or email address, returning the full contact details if found and providing clear error messages if not.
3. Display all contacts in the address book upon request.
4. Provide functionality to delete contacts from the address book.
5. Allow users, after finding a contact, the option to edit their details.
6. Store all vCard files within a single file for streamlined management.

The program architecture consists of three main files:

- `Main.py`: Responsible for driving the core logic of the application, serving as the entry point for launching the program.
- `Helper_functions.py`: Houses essential functions handling operations for each specified task.
- `Read_write_into_file.py`: Manages system interactions for reading, writing, and deleting contents.

The program follows a structured menu-driven approach:

1. Present users with a numbered menu for task selection:
    - Enter new vCard
    - Search vCard
    - Print all vCards
    - Delete vCard
    - End Program

This professional approach ensures efficient vCard management, empowering users to perform key operations seamlessly within the application's framework.
